Today, I learned some Git command lines to connect my local repository with a remote Github repository.
I have heard about pull and push functions in GitHub several times, but this is my first time using these functions in the command line
(CMD).
The usage of command lines to connect local and remote servers surprises me a lot. It reminds me how I used HTTP Request Methods last semester
to enable communication between clients and servers.

To set the environment, I need to install Git on my computer.

The command lines I have tried are below:
-git clone URL
-git commit -m "the message I wanna commit"
-git push
-git status
-git add ./
-git pull 

-browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"
